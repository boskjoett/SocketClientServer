# Description

This repo contains a TCP socket client and server console application.

The client sends a message to the server over a TCP connection and 
the server echoes the message back to the client.

These two simple applications can be used to test the persistence of a TCP
connection.

The interval between messages from the client to the server is doubled in every iteration.
